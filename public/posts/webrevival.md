today i migrated this domain from render.com to google cloud run. render.com does like my 2 least favourite things, charges for usage hours which is stupid because they don't reset monthly, and have an insanely slow cold start. i think it rebuilds ALL of my npm packages on each cold start.

for those of you who dont know what on earth npm is, it basically is a big bloated mess that is in love with getting rid of all of your computer storage and taking years upon years to install.

Webrevival is fucking cool and i'd like u guys to give it a go. go on neocities and just make shit, join a webring and support other people&apos;s shit.

i&apos;ve personally found a bunch of cool stuff just looking around the internet. [postbox.garden](https://postbox.garden) is an imageboard that you can only post to by actually mailing a postcard to their garden in boston.

[rgbteahouse](https://rgbteahouse.neocities.org/home) is one of the first sites i ever visited while looking through webrings and neocities. The owner is very friendly and they are very talented at art.

[low tech magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about) run a website powered entirely on solar panels. They have a lot of really cool sustainability related content and i always love reading it.\ni hope you consider making your own content on the internet because every day it is becoming more corporatized and used as a marketing tool

thank you for reading!!! :hugs:
